## Week 10 (3rd August to 9th August)

The week started a bit slower since I was unwell, but once back on track, I worked on improving visibility and usability of benchmark results. Thanks to Purvaâ€™s earlier feedback, the CI workflows now display tables for `toqito` and `qutipy`, making it much easier to interpret results without digging into raw JSON logs.

From there, I focused on the next logical step: combining benchmark outputs from different libraries. This culminated in [PR #21](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/21), which introduced a combine.py script and a corresponding GitHub Actions workflow. Now, once all individual benchmark jobs finish, their results are automatically merged into a unified CSV for easier comparison.

I later realised the script works perfectly fine but the Github Actions job fails.
