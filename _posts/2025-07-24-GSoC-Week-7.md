## Week 7 ( 14th July to 20th July)

This week was a bit hectic as I was travelling back to my university and my mentors were also away. Despite the lighter schedule, I made an inch of a progress.

Once back to my university, I opened [PR #18](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/18) to add `ruff` into the project. Alongside this, I completed the CI integration for [ketjl benchmarks](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/15) as my mentors had previously requested.

By the weekend, I pushed for merging [PR #14](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/14), the large benchmarks PR, since it was blocking some follow-up work and with approval from mentors, that was finally unblocked.

### Progress:

- [PR #18](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/18): Add ruff
    - Integrated `ruff` into pre-commit hooks for linting
    - Cleaned some outdated imports and placeholder tests in this PR too
- [PR #15](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/15) ketjl benchmarks in CI
    - GitHub Actions now run `ket.jl` benchmark setup automatically.
- [PR #14](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/14) Benchmarks
    - Succesfully merged after changes!
