## Week 9 (27th July to 2nd August)

I began the week by finalizing a PR that integrated benchmarks across all three libraries we had targeted so far. With `toqito`, `qutipy`, and `ketjl` benchmarks now running in CI, we discussed on what to do ahead.


In my original proposal, I had promised benchmarking across multiple ecosystems, and naturally, MATLAB’s `QETLAB`
is the next candidate. But in a quick discussion with Vincent and Purva, we also considered whether benchmarking against more general-purpose quantum frameworks like `Qiskit` or `Pennylane` could be valuable. The main concern was overlap; while `Qiskit` and `Pennylane` do provide primitives like `partial_trace` and `partial_transpose`, their scope is broader and less directly comparable to `toqito`.

Another thread this week was improving CI results reporting. Purva pointed out that while the benchmarks were running
, the outputs weren’t visible in a clear table format, unlike `toqito`’s own coverage reports. This led me to experiment with ways to generate pytest-style result tables for benchmarks, at least for Python-based runs. I confirmed this is feasible for `toqito` and `qutipy`, though it’s less straightforward for `ketjl` and `QETLAB`.

### Progress:

- [PR #19](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/19): Add Bench 1
    - Started investigating results table generation for CI output (similar to coverage reports).

- Started planning next benchmarking targets:

    - `QETLAB` (`MATLAB`) — likely next since it has direct overlap with toqito.
    - `Pennylane` / `Qiskit` — under consideration, though functional overlap may be shallow.
