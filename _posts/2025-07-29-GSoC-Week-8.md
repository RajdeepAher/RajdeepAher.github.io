## Week 8 ( 20th July to 26th July)

I began the week by shortlisting which functions should be included in the final benchmark set for `toqito`. To make this decision, I ranked the repository files by import frequency and selected functions that would give both breadth and depth of coverage. Functions like `toqito.states.basis`, `toqito.matrix_ops.to_density_matrix`, `and toqito.perms.permute_systems` made the cut, while utility checks like `is_square` and `is_density` were excluded as they didnâ€™t provide meaningful benchmarking data.

The majority of the week went into implementing [PR #19](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/19)
, which introduced 48 commits worth of benchmarks spanning core linear algebra, states, permutations, and channels. In parallel, I also added support for ketjl benchmarks ([PR #20](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/20)
), bringing Julia into parity with `toqito` and `qutipy`.

By the end of the week, the project had CI workflows running benchmarks for all three libraries, with over a dozen new functions benchmarked consistently across implementations.

### Progress:

- [PR #19](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/19)
    - Added benchmarks for 20+ core functions across `toqito` and `qutipy`.
    - Added benchmarks for random generators.
    - Introduced CI workflows for both `toqito` and `qutipy` benchmark runs.

- [PR #20](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/20) Add benchmarks in `ketjl`
    - Added Julia (`ketjl`) benchmarks for most of the same functions as above.

### Issues:

- In `ketjl` benchmarks, boolean values in configs (e.g., `True`) needed to be handled as strings for proper run ID-ing; otherwise Julia treated them as logical values, which caused merge issues.

- Some placeholder/commented-out benchmark suites (e.g., `apply_map`) still need bug fixes before enabling.
