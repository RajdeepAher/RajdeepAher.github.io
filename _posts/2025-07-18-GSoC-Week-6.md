## Week 6 (7th July to 13th July)

This week was a big step forward in terms of progress. I started adding benchmarks at scale for `toqito` and `qutipy`. After setting up the infrastructure in previous weeks, the workflow is now smooth enough that I could begin systematically covering functions. I also worked on extending support to other libraries `(ket.jl)` and started planning for future integrations like `QETLAB`.

I opened a [draft PR](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/14), which already covers 10 functions across `toqito` and `qutipy`. To keep things manageable, I decided to cap each PR at ~ 1000 lines of code, otherwise reviewing everything at once would become overwhelming as the suite grows. In addition, I prepared a follow-up [PR for ket.jl](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/15), and I plan to bring in `QETLAB` benchmarks once the `matlab_ci` branch is merged.

### Progress:

- [PR #14](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/14): Add benchmarks

- [PR #15](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/15): Add ket.jl benchmarks
    - Extended `Makefile` and `README` to include ket.jl setup.
    - Added `scripts/benchmark_ketjl.jl` for partial trace benchmarks.
    - Added `setup/test_ketjl.jl` for environment validation.
    - Began work on histogram visualizations for benchmark results (currently a TODO).
    - Added a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically verify `ket.jl` benchmarks.


### Issues Discovered:

- Reviewing the benchmarks raised some naming clarity issues (e.g., parameter naming inside parametrized tests). This is an ongoing consistency task across the suite.

- For `ket.jl`, histogram visualizations are not yet implemented. Benchmark outputs exist, but visual summaries still need to be generated.
