## Week 3 (16th June to 22nd June)

I resolved [this issue](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/issues/4) and benchmarked the `partial_trace` function from both `QuTiPy` and `toqito`. 

The initial write-ups and methodology can be found in [this comment](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/issues/4#issuecomment-2967868123).

Below are the results, Full results [here](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/issues/4#issuecomment-2967868123):

To compare performance, I calculated speedup using the ratio `mean_toqito / mean_qutipy`. Basic profiling revealed that in both implementations, the `permute_systems` function is the primary bottleneck, accounting for nearly half the total runtime.
For `QuTIPy`:

For `toqito`:

While profiling, I discovered that the check `is_vec = np.min(input_mat_dims) == 1` was a surprising bottleneck. Replacing it with a simpler condition — `input_mat_dims[0] == 1` or `input_mat_dims[1] == 1` — led to a significant speedup of over `20x` (roughly `27.5x` in some cases). Interestingly, I noticed that despite this local optimization, the total execution time occasionally increased, which is something I'm looking to investigate further.

We overcame the major bottleneck of identifying corresponding functions across libraries, which marked a significant breakthrough. The discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/issues/3#issuecomment-2988230881). Vincent and I finalized the list of benchmarking identifiers in [this comment](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/issues/3#issuecomment-2996203883).

The week concluded with the completion of benchmarks for the `channel_ops/` module in `toqito`.
