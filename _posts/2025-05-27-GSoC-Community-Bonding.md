## Community Bonding period

### Introduction

My name is Rajdeep Aher, and I am currently at the end of my sophomore year, pursuing an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Roorkee. I was born and raised in Mumbai. Since my first year, I have been drawn to mathematics and had a growing curiosity about programming, which led me to take my first steps into the world of Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory.

It was only towards the end of February 2025 that I discovered I could contribute to quantum software and develop meaningful tools for Quantum Information Theory. I am deeply grateful to Google, the maintainers of Toqito, and numFOCUS for this incredible opportunity to work on benchmarking and profiling for Toqito as part of GSoC 2025.


## Interaction and Ideation

During this time, I had a meeting with Vincent shortly after my selection. We introduced ourselves and 
discussed the flexibility of tasks and responsibilities. A significant portion of the period was spent 
brainstorming whether to create a separate repository or continue within the existing one. I explored 
references such as [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/benchmarks/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#directory-structure) and [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-benchmark), noting that 
most libraries maintain a distinct benchmark repository. Based on this, we decided to proceed with a separate 
repository. I also reviewed the issues outlined by the mentors regarding the repository setup and began 
thinking about possible solutions. This blog was written during the same timeframe.
