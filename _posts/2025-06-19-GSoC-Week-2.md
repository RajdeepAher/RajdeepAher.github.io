## Week 2 (9th June to 15th June)

I was feeling slightly unwell this week, so my contributions to 
the repository were limited. I focused on finalizing the setup 
instructions for `Python`, `Julia`, and `MATLAB`, which are 
detailed in this [pull request](https://github.com/vprusso/
toqito-bench/pull/11). The virtual environment setup 
specifically applies to `Python` and `Julia`, not `MATLAB`.

Since my educational institution provides a MATLAB subscription, 
I am able to run it locally on my Windows system, although I 
typically use WSL for most of my work. A more detailed setup 
guideline can be found in this [comment](https://github.com/
vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/11#issuecomment-2948848008).

We also explored the possibility of including `MATLAB` in the CI/
CD pipeline without requiring a license. Further discussion on 
this is available in [this comment](https://github.com/vprusso/
toqito-bench/pull/11#issuecomment-2954241468).
