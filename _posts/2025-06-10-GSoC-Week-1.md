## 2nd June to 8th June

I completed [Issue #1](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/issues/1), which involved initializing the 
`toqito-bench` repository with a basic structure and a continuous integration (CI) stub. Further details can 
be found in this [pull request](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito-bench/pull/9). We — referring to my mentors 
and me — discussed the possibility of using `uv` instead of `poetry` for package management. However, since 
`uv` is relatively new and does not yet support `julia`, we decided not to proceed with it. That said, a 
possible approach for integrating `uv` with `toqito` is outlined [here](https://github.com/vprusso/
toqito-bench/pull/9#issuecomment-2929653079).

The first week involved relatively light tasks as we began laying the groundwork.
